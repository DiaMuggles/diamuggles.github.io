# Welcome to DiaMuggles Main Github Page
This is just a main-sub-Domain for hosting all Github Projects. 
While this page itself is also a github Repo, and is opensource too, but nothing fancy in the sourcecode here.

At the moment Diamuggles has the following Project:

* [Simple Swarm job creator in python](http://git.diamuggles.com/simple-python-swarm)
* [Jason Parser](http://git.diamuggles.com/json-parser-java)
* [Rename Default Xnat style Dicom Files](http://git.diamuggles.com/xnat-rename-files)

We will probably try to make this page look better. But there are so many new things to learn, and so many things to do, chances are we may just leave it simple and (mildly-)sweet.  :P
